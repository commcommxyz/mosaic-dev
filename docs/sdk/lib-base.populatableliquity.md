```typescript
export interface PopulatableMosaic<R = unknown, S = unknown, P = unknown> extends _PopulatableFrom<SendableMosaic<R, S>, P> 
```
<b>Extends:</b> \_PopulatableFrom&lt;[SendableMosaic](./lib-base.sendablemosaic.md)<!-- -->&lt;R, S&gt;, P&gt;

## Remarks

The functions return an object implementing [PopulatedMosaicTransaction](./lib-base.populatedmosaictransaction.md)<!-- -->, which can be used to send the transaction and get a [SentMosaicTransaction](./lib-base.sentmosaictransaction.md)<!-- -->.

Implemented by [PopulatableEthersMosaic](./lib-ethers.populatableethersmosaic.md)<!-- -->.
