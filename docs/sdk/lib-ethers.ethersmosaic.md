## EthersMosaic class

Convenience class that combines multiple interfaces of the library in one object.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare class EthersMosaic implements ReadableEthersMosaic, TransactableMosaic 
```
<b>Implements:</b> [ReadableEthersMosaic](./lib-ethers.readableethersmosaic.md)<!-- -->, [TransactableMosaic](./lib-base.transactablemosaic.md)

## Remarks

The constructor for this class is marked as internal. Third-party code should not call the constructor directly or create subclasses that extend the `EthersMosaic` class.
