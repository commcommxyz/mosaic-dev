## PopulatedRedemption interface

A redemption transaction that has been prepared for sending.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export interface PopulatedRedemption<P = unknown, S = unknown, R = unknown> extends PopulatedMosaicTransaction<P, SentMosaicTransaction<S, MosaicReceipt<R, RedemptionDetails>>> 
```
<b>Extends:</b> [PopulatedMosaicTransaction](./lib-base.populatedmosaictransaction.md)<!-- -->&lt;P, [SentMosaicTransaction](./lib-base.sentmosaictransaction.md)<!-- -->&lt;S, [MosaicReceipt](./lib-base.mosaicreceipt.md)<!-- -->&lt;R, [RedemptionDetails](./lib-base.redemptiondetails.md)<!-- -->&gt;&gt;&gt;

## Remarks

The Mosaic protocol fulfills redemptions by repaying the debt of Troves in ascending order of their collateralization ratio, and taking a portion of their collateral in exchange. Due to the [minimum debt](./lib-base.msic_minimum_debt.md) requirement that Troves must fulfill, some MoUSD amounts are not possible to redeem exactly.

When [redeemMoUSD()](./lib-base.populatablemosaic.redeemmsic.md) is called with an amount that can't be fully redeemed, the amount will be truncated (see the `redeemableMoUSDAmount` property). When this happens, the redeemer can either redeem the truncated amount by sending the transaction unchanged, or prepare a new transaction by [increasing the amount](./lib-base.populatedredemption.increaseamountbyminimumnetdebt.md) to the next lowest possible value, which is the sum of the truncated amount and [MoUSD\_MINIMUM\_NET\_DEBT](./lib-base.msic_minimum_net_debt.md)<!-- -->.
